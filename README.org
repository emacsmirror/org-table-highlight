* Installation

Via =use-package= for Emacs 30:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package org-table-highlight
  :vc (:url "https://www.github.com/llcc/org-table-highlight" :rev :newest)
  :hook (org-mode . org-table-highlight-mode)
  :config
  (add-hook 'after-init-hook #'org-table-highlight-load-metadata))
#+end_src

Or manually:

1. Copy =org-table-highlight.el= to a directory in your =load-path=
2. Add the following to your init file:
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
   (require 'org-table-highlight)
   #+end_src

* Usage

Open an Org table and run the interactive commands:

| Command                                     | Description                               |
|---------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------|
| ~org-table-highlight-column~                  | Highlight the current column              |
| ~org-table-highlight-row~                     | Highlight the current row                 |
| ~org-table-highlight-clear-column-highlights~ | Clear current/all column highlights       |
| ~org-table-highlight-clear-row-highlights~    | Clear current/all row highlights          |
| ~org-table-highlight-clear-all-highlights~    | Clear all highlights in the current table |

The =org-table-highlight-column= command supports prefix arguments to modify its behavior:
- None prefix: highlight the current column using a pre-defined default color.
- C-u: Prompt for a custom color, then apply it to the current column.
- C-u C-u: Prompt for a predicate string, then only highlight fields that match the condition.
  Predicate string accept numeric comparisons such as >10, <10, =10, and !=10, and can be combined using logical operators and and or for more complex conditions. 
- C-u C-u C-u: In addition to the above, extend the highlight across the entire row where the condition matches.

For example, in the image below, only the rows where the years exceed 10 are highlighted.

* Customization

Customize the color palette by modifying this variable:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-table-highlight-color-palette
      '("#FFFACD" "#E0FFFF" "#FFCCCC" "#E6E6FA"))
#+end_src

If a table doesn't have a `#+NAME:`, highlights will still be restored using surrounding context (`before-string` and `after-string`).
You can improve reliability by optionally adding `#+NAME:` to important tables.
To control how much context is saved around unnamed tables:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-table-highlight-table-context-length 20)
#+end_src

The highlights are stored in =org-table-highlight-metadata-file= which defaults to =~/.emacs.d/org-table-highlight-metadata.el=.
